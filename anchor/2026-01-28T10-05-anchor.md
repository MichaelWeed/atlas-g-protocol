## Current Status

- **Streaming Issue**: RESOLVED via Async Audit Streaming in `governance.py` and `agent.py`.
- **Model Enforcement**: LOCKED to `gemini-3-flash-preview` via `config.py` guardrail comments.

## Key Decisions

- **Async Governance**: Compliance checks must yield audit logs to prevent perceived UI buffering during the initial LLM classification phase.
- **Strict Model Law**: Never switch models for "troubleshooting" if the project is architected for a specific build. Use "AI-trap" comments to prevent reflexive switching.

## Open Items

- [ ] Verify real-world "feel" on `michaelweed.xyz` after Cloud Run finishes the current deployment.
- [ ] Monitor logs for `🌊 STREAM CHUNK` timestamps to confirm WebSocket flushing.

## Style/Context Notes

- Maintain terminal-style aesthetics.
- Ensure all agent responses end with terminal punctuation (Governance filter enforced).
