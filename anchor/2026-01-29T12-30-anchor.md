## Headline

Resolved production streaming issues by prioritizing the diagnostic protocol and tuning transport delays. Synchronized private and public repositories with enhanced sanitization.

## Critical Facts & Invariants

- **Streaming Logic**: Prioritized `test:stream` in `agent.py`. Increased chunk delay to `0.05s` to facilitate Cloud Run flushes.
- **Model Law**: Enforced `gemini-3-flash-preview`. Corrected audit log labels to reflect "Gemini 3 Flash".
- **Repo Sync**:
  - `private`: 1:1 sync on `master`.
  - `public`: Sanitized sync on `master`. `data/resume.txt`, `.env`, and `data/*.json` are gitignored.
- **Internal Data**: Added diagnostic logging in `main.py` for resume loading issues.

## Accomplishments

- Fixed `test:stream` bypass issue where the LLM was intercepting the command.
- Verified absence of PII in public-commit history.
- Successfully pushed the latest "Atlas-G Protocol" state to both remotes.

## Next Micro-Goals

- Deploy the latest `master` to Cloud Run and run `test:stream` on the production URL.
- Verify `[INTERNAL DATA]` logs in Cloud Run for successful resume ingestion.

## Context Notes

- Users can ask the agent about resume details (which is the point of the portfolio), but the raw data is protected from bot scraping via gitignore in the public repo.
